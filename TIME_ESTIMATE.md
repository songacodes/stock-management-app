## Time Estimates by Team Size

### Solo Developer (Full-time)
- **8-12 weeks** (as detailed above)

### Two Developers (Full-stack team)
- **5-7 weeks** (parallel frontend/backend development)

### Three Developers (Frontend + Backend + DevOps)
- **4-6 weeks** (specialized roles, faster development)

### Small Team (4-5 developers)
- **3-4 weeks** (with proper project management)

---

## Factors That May Affect Timeline

### ⚠️ Extending Timeline:
- Learning curve for new technologies
- Complex visual preview system requirements
- Advanced ML for image recognition
- Extensive customization requirements
- Multiple revisions and feedback cycles
- Integration with external systems
- Mobile app development (if added)

### ✅ Reducing Timeline:
- Using pre-built UI components
- Simplified visual preview (2D instead of 3D)
- Basic image matching (no ML)
- MVP approach (core features first)
- Experienced team with domain knowledge
- Minimal customization

---

## MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Timeline

**If you want to launch faster with core features only: 4-5 weeks**

**MVP Features:**
- ✅ User authentication
- ✅ Tile CRUD operations
- ✅ Stock management (add/remove)
- ✅ Sales recording
- ✅ Basic reports (stock, sales)
- ✅ Simple dashboard
- ✅ Image upload

**Excluded from MVP:**
- ❌ Visual preview system (can add later)
- ❌ Image-based recognition (can add later)
- ❌ Multi-shop sync (can add later)
- ❌ Advanced analytics

---

## Recommended Approach

1. **Start with MVP** (4-5 weeks) - Get core functionality working
2. **Iterate and add features** - Add advanced features incrementally
3. **User feedback** - Gather feedback and improve
4. **Scale** - Add multi-shop, sync, and advanced features

## Milestones

| Milestone | Week | Deliverable |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| M1: Backend Foundation | Week 2 | Working APIs, Auth, Database |
| M2: Core Backend APIs | Week 4 | All CRUD operations working |
| M3: Frontend Foundation | Week 5 | UI structure, Auth UI |
| M4: Core Frontend | Week 7 | All forms and basic pages |
| M5: Advanced Features | Week 9 | Preview, recognition, multi-shop |
| M6: Production Ready | Week 12 | Deployed, tested, documented |

**Note**: These estimates are for guidance. Actual time may vary based on:
- Developer experience level
- Project requirements clarity
- Technology familiarity
- Testing requirements
- Quality standards
